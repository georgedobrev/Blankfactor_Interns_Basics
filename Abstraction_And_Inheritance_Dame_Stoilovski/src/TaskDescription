Task on Inheritance, Polymorphism and Abstraction

For this task you will have to create a small app that will have to contain the following:
1. At least one abstract class
2. At least 2 inheriting classes derived from the abstract
3. At least 2 interfaces each implemented by any of the classes. Can be either or both, choice is yours.

You can either meet the minimum or do more. This will not affect your scores, but the minimum requirements listed above should be met.
The topic chosen is up to you. You will not be evaluated for realism but on the technical implementation. So do not worry if no one needs a goat petting app!
The originality of the idea will also not be considered, so do not worry if it's nothing original.

But here is a list of suggestions that you can consider if you're having a hard time coming up with a topic:
1. A dispatcher app that handles delivery of mail and parcels within the city, country and abroad, or the travel destinations of transport trucks, or the loading of goods.
2. An app that deals with crops and farmland.
3. Tourism app that deals with sights, individual tourists and touring groups etc
4. A multi-language dictionary

The task description is deliberately vague. You will have to exercise coming up with ideas and designing the app.
Think about what possibilities there are to reflect real world objects and concepts in code.

Deadline is Wednesday. We have a long weekend so there should be enough time to complete the task.
If you have any questions about any of it you can ping me on Slack.

Have a good weekend.
