//The printer in the office has two types of paper: plain and glossy, which are represented by the numbers 0 and 1, respectively
// . Employees start submitting tasks to the printer.
// Each job is specifying the type of paper it requires.
//The number of papers in the printer is equal to the number of tasks.
//Before the execution of each task:
//If it prefers the paper type that is currently available, the task will be executed.
//Otherwise, the paper remains unused and ready for the next task. And the current task will be placed
// as last and will wait for all others to be done so it can try again.
//This continues until none of the tasks want to take the top paper and are thus unable to print the document.
// Write a function that accepts two parameters: an array of tasks and an array of papersâ€™ type and returns the number of tasks that are unable to finish.
